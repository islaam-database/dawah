## The Severity of Bid'ah

And Akhee, may Allaah have mercy upon you, know that Bid'ah (innovations) in the religion, is one of the worst evils ever.

Jaabir bin Abdullah narrated about the prophet ﷺ:

> When the Messenger (alayhis salaam) would deliver a sermon, his eyes would be come red, his voice would be raised, and his anger would be severe, as if he was admonishing an army... and he would say, "To proceed, indeed the best speech is the speech of Allaah and the best guidance is the guidance of Muhammad and the **worst of affairs (in the religion) are the newly-invented matters**, and every innovation is misguidance." - [Saheeh Muslim](http://www.bidah.com/articles/zhayx-the-completion-and-perfection-of-the-shariah.cfm)

The prophet ﷺ said:

> Whoever **innovates** or accomodates an innovator then upon him is the curse of Allaah, His Angels and the whole of mankind. - [Reported by Bukhaaree (12/41) and Muslim (9/140)](http://www.spubs.com/sps/sp.cfm?subsecID=BDH02&articleID=BDH020002&articlePages=1)

Imaam ash-Shaafi'ee said:

> That a person meets Allaah with every sin except Shirk is better than meeting Him upon any one of the **innovated beliefs**. - [Reported by al-Bayhaqee in al-I'tiqaad (p.158)](http://www.salafipublications.com/sps/sp.cfm?subsecID=BDH05&articleID=BDH050003&articlePages=1)

Ibn Abbaas, the companion of the messenger of Allaah ﷺ, said:

> Indeed the most detestable of things to Allaah are the **innovations**. - [Reported by al-Bayhaqee in as-Sunan al-Kubraa (4/316)](http://www.spubs.com/sps/sp.cfm?subsecID=BDH02&articleID=BDH020002&articlePages=1)

Sufyaan ath-Thawree, one of the Imaams of the Salaf, said:

> **Innovation** is more beloved to Iblees (Shaytaan) than sin, since a sin may be repented from but innovation is not repented from. - [Reported by al-Laalikaa'ee (no. 238)](http://www.spubs.com/sps/sp.cfm?subsecID=BDH02&articleID=BDH020002&articlePages=1)

Imaam Ahmad said:

> The graves of Ahl us-Sunnah from the people of major sins are a garden. And the graves of Ahl ul-Bid'ah from the pious abstemious ones are a pit. The sinful of Ahl us-Sunnah are the awliyaa (friends) of Allaah, and the pious, abstemious of **Ahl ul-Bid'ah are the enemies of Allaah**. - [Tabaqaat al-Hanaabilah (1/184)](http://www.manhaj.com/manhaj/articles/aiiyu-the-innovators-are-more-evil-and-harmful-than-the-sinners-and-disobedient.cfm)
