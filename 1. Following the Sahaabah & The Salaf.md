## Following the Sahaabah

Akhee, may Allaah bless you, know that we have to follow Islaam the way of the Sahaabah, and not just anyone's interpretation of Islaam. Allaah, The Most High, said:

> وَٱلسَّٰبِقُونَ ٱلْأَوَّلُونَ مِنَ ٱلْمُهَٰجِرِينَ وَٱلْأَنصَارِ **وَٱلَّذِينَ ٱتَّبَعُوهُم** بِإِحْسَٰنٍ رَّضِىَ ٱللَّهُ عَنْهُمْ وَرَضُوا۟ عَنْهُ وَأَعَدَّ لَهُمْ جَنَّٰتٍ تَجْرِى تَحْتَهَا ٱلْأَنْهَٰرُ خَٰلِدِينَ فِيهَآ أَبَدًا ذَٰلِكَ ٱلْفَوْزُ ٱلْعَظِيمُ

> And the first forerunners [in the faith] among the Muhajireen and the Ansar and **those who followed them** with good conduct - Allah is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him, and He has prepared for them gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide forever. That is the great attainment. - [Sooratut-Tawbah (9:100)](http://www.thenoblequran.com/q/#/verse/9/100)

So in this verse, my brother, Allaah mentioned the Muhaajiroon (ie. the Sahaabah that made Hijrah form Mecca to Madeenah) and the Ansar (the Sahaabah that were in Madeenah), and then Allaah mentioned those who follow them, that He is pleased with them and they are going to Jannah. So this shows that we must follow the Sahaabah.

The prophet ﷺ also said:

> خير هذه الأمة القرن الذي بعثت فيهم ، ثم الذين يلونهم ، ثم الذين يلونهم ؛ ثم الذين يلونهم

> The best of this Ummah is **the generation to which I have been sent**. Then those who come after them, then those who come after them, then those who come after them. - [Saheeh al-Bukhaaree](http://www.aqidah.com/creed/articles/oeotc-glimpses-into-the-splitting-of-the-muslim-ummah-part-1.cfm)

And obviously, his generation was the generation of the Sahaabah. And even logically it makes sense to follow the Sahaabah since they know the religion the best:

1. They were right there with the prophet ﷺ.
2. They were there when verses of the Quran were revealed to see the time it was revealed, the place it was revealed, the context it was revealed in, and how it was implemented. Same with Hadeeth.
3. They were were with the prophet ﷺ so he can tell them if they did something wrong.
4. They know the Arabic language the best, which was their native language, which is the language of the Quran and Sunnah.

The prophet ﷺ also said:

>  فإنه من يعش منكم بعدي فسيرى اختلافا كثيرا فعليكم بسنتي وسنة الخلفاء المهديين الراشدين تمسكوا بها وعضوا عليها بالنواجذ

> For verily, whoever amongst you lives for long after me will see great differences. So upon you is to follow my Sunnah and the Sunnah of my **rightly-guided successors (caliphs)**. Hold fast to it (the Sunnah) and bite onto it with your molar-teeth.

And the rightly guided caliphs were the best from the Sahaabah. Notice, the prophet ﷺ could have just said "hold on to my Sunnah" and that's it. But he added to it that we have to strictly follow Sunnah of the rightly guided caliphs, who were from the best of the Sahaabah. Obviously, this is because their Sunnah came from the Sunnah of the prophet ﷺ.

And the prophet ﷺ said:

> وتفترق أمتي على ثلاث وسبعين فرقة ، كلها في النار إلا واحدة " فقيل له : ما الواحدة ؟ قال : " ما أنا عليه اليوم وأصحابي

> And my ummah will split into seventy-three sects, all of them in the Fire except for one. So it was said to him, "What is this one?". He said: That which **I am and my Companions are upon** today. - [Saheeh in Sunan at-Tirmidhee](http://www.aqidah.com/creed/articles/oeotc-glimpses-into-the-splitting-of-the-muslim-ummah-part-1.cfm)

So this is proof that it's not just good to follow the Sahaabah. It's mandatatory, Waajib, obligatory to follow the Sahaabah.

Imaam Ahmad ibn Hanbal, may Allaah be pleased with him, said:

> أصول السنة عندنا: التمسك بما كان عليه أصحاب رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم - والاقتداء بهم،

> The foundational principles of the Sunnah with us are: Holding fast to what the **Companions** of the Messenger of Allaah were upon. Taking them [and their way] as a model to be followed. - [Usool as-Sunnah](http://www.aqidah.com/creed/articles/oeotc-glimpses-into-the-splitting-of-the-muslim-ummah-part-1.cfm)

And as mentioned previously, the prophet ﷺ praised the first three generations of this Ummah, and the scholars call these 3 generations "The Salaf." So it's Waajib, obligatory, required to follow the Salaf.

And a person who follows the Sunnah is called a "Sunn**ee**." A person from Pakistan is called a "Pakistaan**ee**." A Shi'ah individual is called a "Shee'**ee**." And the followers of the Madhhab of Imaam Abu Haneefah are called "Hanaf**ee**." So my brother in Islaam, you should follow the Salaf of this Ummah and be a **Salafee**. Just like we call ourselves Sunnee, calling ourselves Salafee is a clarification on how we follow the Sunnah... ie. the way of the Salaf.

So Akhee, I hope this is clear. Did that make sense? Do you accept that it's Waajib to follow the Sahaabah, the Salaf, and to be a Salafee?
