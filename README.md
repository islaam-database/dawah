# Ad-Dawatus Salafiyyah

The plan for this repository is to hold Da'wah material written in Markdown to support reddit. The Da'wah material is written in order. Go one by one, and only move on to the next once they accept the previous one. 

## The Order of the Da'wah

Send the user the following, one-by-one, and only move on once they accept the previous step.

0. Remove doubts about Islaam -  Ask if the person has any doubts about Islaam. If so, remove those doubts first. Then move on to the next step.
2. Following the Sahaabah & the Salaf-us-Saalih and being a "Salafee."
3. Leaving the people of innovation.
4. Recommend some scholars and students of knowledge to benefit from.
5. Warn against Taweel & Tafweed.
