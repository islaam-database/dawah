## Abonding the People of Innovation

Akhee, may Allaah bless you, it's also required from us that we **abondon** the people of innovation (people of Bid'ah). And this is something that the Sahaabah were upon and all agreed to.

The prophet ﷺ said:

> Whoever innovates or **accommodates an innovator** then upon him is the curse of Allaah, His Angels and the whole of mankind. - [Reported by Bukhaaree (12/41) and Muslim (9/140)](http://www.salafipublications.com/sps/sp.cfm?subsecID=BDH05&articleID=BDH050003&articlePages=1)

Imaam Ahmad said:

> أصول السنة عندنا: التمسك بما كان عليه أصحاب رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم - والاقتداء بهم، وترك البدع وكل بدعة فهي ضلالة، وترك الخصومات والجلوس مع أصحاب الأهواء

> The foundational principles of the Sunnah with us are: Holding fast to what the Companions of the Messenger of Allaah were upon. Taking them [and their way] as a model to be followed. The abandonment of innovations, and every innovation is misguidance. The abandonment of controversies and the **abandonment of sitting with the people of ahwaa (desires)**. - [Usool as-Sunnah](http://www.aqidah.com/creed/articles/oeotc-glimpses-into-the-splitting-of-the-muslim-ummah-part-1.cfm)

[And people of desires are really people of Bid'ah](https://salaficentre.com/2019/10/one-of-the-reasons-ahlul-bidah-the-people-of-bidah-are-called-ahlul-ahwaa-people-of-desires/).

Allaah said in Soorat al-Mumtahinah:

> لَّا تَجِدُ قَوْمًا يُؤْمِنُونَ بِٱللَّهِ وَٱلْيَوْمِ ٱلْءَاخِرِ يُوَآدُّونَ مَنْ حَآدَّ ٱللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُۥ وَلَوْ كَانُوٓا۟ ءَابَآءَهُمْ أَوْ أَبْنَآءَهُمْ أَوْ إِخْوَٰنَهُمْ أَوْ عَشِيرَتَهُمْ أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ كَتَبَ فِى قُلُوبِهِمُ ٱلْإِيمَٰنَ وَأَيَّدَهُم بِرُوحٍ مِّنْهُ وَيُدْخِلُهُمْ جَنَّٰتٍ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهَا ٱلْأَنْهَٰرُ خَٰلِدِينَ فِيهَا رَضِىَ ٱللَّهُ عَنْهُمْ وَرَضُوا۟ عَنْهُ أُو۟لَٰٓئِكَ حِزْبُ ٱللَّهِ أَلَآ إِنَّ حِزْبَ ٱللَّهِ هُمُ ٱلْمُفْلِحُونَ

> You will not find a people who believe in Allah and the Last Day having affection for those who oppose Allah and His Messenger, even if they were their fathers or their sons or their brothers or their kindred. Those - He has decreed within their hearts faith and supported them with spirit from Him. And We will admit them to gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they abide eternally. Allah is pleased with them, and they are pleased with Him - those are the party of Allah. Unquestionably, the party of Allah - they are the successful. - [Soorat al-Mumtahinah](http://www.thenoblequran.com/q/#/verse/58/22)

Al-Hasan al-Basree, who was praised by ibn 'Umar (the son of 'Umar ibn al-Khattaab), said:

> Do not sit with the people of innovation and desires, nor argue with them, nor listen to them. - [Reported by al-Laalikaa'ee in Sharh Usool ul-I'tiqaad (no.267).](http://www.aqidah.com/creed/articles/oeotc-glimpses-into-the-splitting-of-the-muslim-ummah-part-1.cfm)

Al-Fudayl bin 'Iyaad (one of the Imaams of the Salaf generation) said: 

> I met the best of people, all of them people of the Sunnah and they used to forbid from accompanying the people of innovation. - [Reported by al-Laalikaa'ee in Sharh Usool ul-Iýtiqaad (no.267)](http://www.aqidah.com/creed/articles/oeotc-glimpses-into-the-splitting-of-the-muslim-ummah-part-1.cfm).

Imaam Maalik ibn Anas said:

> How evil are the people of innovation, we do not give them salaam. - [Reported by al-Baghawee in Sharh us-Sunnah (1/234)](http://www.aqidah.com/creed/articles/oeotc-glimpses-into-the-splitting-of-the-muslim-ummah-part-1.cfm).
